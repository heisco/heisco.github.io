# FAQ

- Q> Where are save files stored?
- A> The save files are named "Autosave_session_v1.sav" and "Autosave_system_v1.sav"
On iOS, it's saved under "CG_Ship/Saved/SaveGames" in the document you can see on iTunes.

Find the old save files in the storage ("Autosave_system_v1.sav" and "Autosave_session_v1.sav") and move them to the correct path(/CG_Ship/Saved/SaveGames). 
Sorry for the inconvenience.
